## What is an operating system

An operating system (OS) is software that manages computer hardware and software resources, providing a layer between applications and the hardware.

It handles memory allocation, process scheduling, file systems, and device I/O, so that programs can run without directly interacting with hardware.

## Operating systems

### `Linux`

`Linux` is an open-source operating system commonly used for servers and [virtual machines](./vm.md).

See [`Linux`](./linux.md) for more details.

### `macOS`

`macOS` is Apple's proprietary operating system for Mac computers.

It is based on `Unix`, so many command-line tools and workflows that work on `Linux` also work on `macOS`.

### `Windows`

`Windows` is Microsoft's proprietary operating system widely used on personal computers.

It uses a different file system structure and command-line environment from `Linux` and `macOS`.

Students on `Windows` can use [`WSL`](#wsl) (Windows Subsystem for Linux) to run a `Linux` environment.

#### `WSL`

`WSL` (Windows Subsystem for Linux) is a feature of `Windows` that lets you run a `Linux` environment directly on `Windows`, without a virtual machine.

> [!TIP]
> To use `WSL` with `VS Code`, see [(`Windows` only) Set up running `VS Code` in `WSL`](./vs-code.md#windows-only-set-up-running-vs-code-in-wsl).
